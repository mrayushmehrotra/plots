      <li>
        As such, I/We acknowledge and declare that I/we have not relied upon nor been influenced by any sales plans,
        sale brochures, advertisements, representations, architects' plans, or any other information or data provided by
        the Promoter or any person representing the Promoter, all of which I/ we understand is tentative and subject to
        change, except as specifically represented in this Application, and I/we have relied solely on my/our own
        judgment in deciding to make the Application for allotment of the Plot.

      </li>
      <br>

      <li>
        Accordingly, I/we, the undersigned Applicants(s), after having read and understood in my vernacular language
        (after translation) also and agreed with the Terms & Conditions, do hereby choose to invest and apply for
        allotment and booking of the Plot as per agreed Payment Plan.


      </li>
      <br>

      <li>
        I/We understand that this Application does not constitute any offer or definitive allotment or any Plot Buyer
        Agreement I/we, the Applicant(s) do not become entitled to allotment of the Plot, notwithstanding the fact, that
        the Promoter may have issued a receipt(s) in acknowledgement of the money tendered with this Application.



      </li>
      <br>

      <li>

        I/ We agree that this Application shall become definitive only after the execution of the Plot Buyer Agreement
        and other documents in the format as specified by the Promoter. In the event the Promoter accepts this
        Application to allot a Plot to me/us, I/we agree to execute all documents/agreements in the format as specified
        by the Promoter and undertake to strictly adhere to all the terms and conditions stipulated by the Promoter from
        time to time and pay all installments/ monies/dues and charges as applicable or as demanded by the Promoter.

        be detailed and comprehensive and shall deal with many other issues besides those mentioned in Schedule- I
        hereto. I/We further understand that the terms and conditions as given in Schedule- I are tentative and subject
        to modification/change in the Plot Buyer Agreement, and which shall then prevail over Schedule - I. It is also
        made clear to me/us that in case of any conflict between the Application Form and the Plot Buyer Agreement, the
        terms of the Plot Buyer Agreement shall supersede and prevail this Application Form.


      </li>
      <br>

      <li>
        Merely forwarding the Plot Buyer Agreement to the Applicant by the Promoter does not create a binding obligation
        on the part of the Promoter until, firstly, the Applicant signs and delivers the Plot Buyer Agreement with all
        the schedules along with the payments due as stipulated in the Payment Plan within 30 (thirty) days from the

        days from the date of receipt of the Plot Buyer Agreement by the Applicant and further execute and register the
