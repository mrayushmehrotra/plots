        change, except as specifically represented in this Application, and I/we have relied solely on my/our own
        judgment in deciding to make the Application for allotment of the Plot.

      </li>
      <br>

      <li>
        Accordingly, I/we, the undersigned Applicants(s), after having read and understood in my vernacular language
        (after translation) also and agreed with the Terms & Conditions, do hereby choose to invest and apply for
        allotment and booking of the Plot as per agreed Payment Plan.


      </li>
      <br>

      <li>
        I/We understand that this Application does not constitute any offer or definitive allotment or any Plot Buyer
        Agreement I/we, the Applicant(s) do not become entitled to allotment of the Plot, notwithstanding the fact, that
        the Promoter may have issued a receipt(s) in acknowledgement of the money tendered with this Application.



      </li>
      <br>

      <li>

        I/ We agree that this Application shall become definitive only after the execution of the Plot Buyer Agreement
        and other documents in the format as specified by the Promoter. In the event the Promoter accepts this
        Application to allot a Plot to me/us, I/we agree to execute all documents/agreements in the format as specified
        by the Promoter and undertake to strictly adhere to all the terms and conditions stipulated by the Promoter from
        time to time and pay all installments/ monies/dues and charges as applicable or as demanded by the Promoter.

      </li>
      <br>

      <li>
        Merely forwarding the Plot Buyer Agreement to the Applicant by the Promoter does not create a binding obligation
        on the part of the Promoter until, firstly, the Applicant signs and delivers the Plot Buyer Agreement with all
        the schedules along with the payments due as stipulated in the Payment Plan within 30 (thirty) days from the
