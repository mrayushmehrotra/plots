        <p class="bold">10. <span class="underline">Escalation:</span></p>
        <p>The Total Price is escalation-free, save and except increases which the Applicant hereby agrees to pay, due to increase on account of development charges/ EDC/IDC payable to the competent authority and/or any other increase in taxes, GST or charges which may be levied or imposed by the competent authority from time to time. The Promoter undertakes and agrees that while raising a demand on the Applicant for increase in development charges, cost/charges/fees/levies etc. imposed by the competent authorities, the Promoter shall enclose the said notification/ order/rule/regulation to that effect along with the demand letter being issued to the Applicant, which shall only be applicable on subsequent payments, unless such imposition is retrospective in nature and earlier payments are covered within the same. Provided that if there is any new imposition or increase of any development charges and/or taxes after the expiry of the scheduled date of completion of the Project (which shall include the extension of registration, if any, granted to the said project by the Authority, as per the Act) as per registration with the Authority, the same shall not be charged from the Allottee if such increase/ extension is (i) owing to any reason which is not solely attributable to the Promoter; or (ii) due to any Force Majeure event; unless such imposition is retrospective in nature and pertains to the period prior to scheduled date of completion of the project (including extension thereof) as specified hereinbefore. It is clarified that in case of any new imposition or increase of development charges and/ or taxes which is retrospective in nature, the same shall be charged from the Applicant(s).</p>

        <p class="bold">12. <span class="underline">Other Charges:</span></p>
        <p>The Applicant(s) shall make all payments in accordance with the Payment Plan. The Applicant(s) shall further make payment of all statutory and third-party charges, including registration charges, stamp duty charges and other charges as and when demanded by the Promoter.</p>

        <p>The Applicant(s) shall make all payments as per the specifications provided in this Application Form. All payments made in this manner shall be subject to encashment. It is specifically clarified to the Applicant that if any amount towards Total Price and any taxes, cess/ fees/ charges/ levies etc. by whatever name called towards the required to be paid by the Applicant on the demand being raised by the Promoter is not deposited in the Account (as specified in this Application Form) in respect of the Project then it will not amount to a valid discharge of Applicantâ€™s obligation to pay the sale consideration or part thereof under the Plot Buyer Agreement to purchase the Plot. In case the Applicant(s) default(s) in the payment of any installment or any other charges, then the Promoter is not under any obligation to send any demand letter or other reminder for payment of installment and/or other charges due, but not paid by the Applicant(s). In case of dishonor of any cheque, the Applicant(s) shall be liable to pay administrative charges equivalent to Rs. 1,000/- (Rupees One Thousand only) per instance in addition to the interest applicable as per the Rules for delayed payment.
